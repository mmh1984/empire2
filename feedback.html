  <p>This is more than five star hotel. Amazing Customers service. <br>
    The staff at   front desk were very nice. The check in supposed be at 2:00pm. We got here at 10.00am. They check us in and gave us beautiful room. <br>
    The hotel is beautiful with stunning location. It's also huge.</p>

  <p>My guide told me that this is a 7-star hotel, and I can see why.. just going around the place, it is huge and kept clean. Even the comfort rooms are quite elegant. Nice to stay for a weekend getaway.</p>

  <p>Stayed on the 13th October for one night with my boyfriend and as soon as we drove up and entered the hall, I was blown away by how beautiful it was. The room was extremely luxurious and the pool area was just incredible for an evening dip, watching the sun go down. The breakfast was nothing short of offering everything and all I can say is I utterly miss the place now being back in the UK. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone also</p>

  <p>The place is TOTALLY awesome. We only visited the place and ate our breakfast here and roam around. This hotel is very very expensive and not recommended for budget travellers. </p>
